There is an endless sea of TTRPG one-shots, rulesets, systems, and simply not enough time to try them all. To cut-down on the time to setup, create a character, introduce the group, and begin a story “starting from zero”, Train Game links diffrent one-shots together into a longer, continous game. It does so by providing two things: a narrative framing device and a set of accompanying mechanics.

## 1. The Framing Device

You are on a train, traveling through space and time. You do not know where it is headed next, and you are begining to suspect that even the conductor is unaware. The train looks like any other 1940s steam locomotive—astroids and space debris ricocheing off the cowcatcher, stars and planets streaked across your window. From inside the cabin you can hear the chug of the engine. You and the other passengers sit large green leather seats. First class. Far more expense than you could afford yourself.

Each of you got on, either thinking it was your train or just some other door, only to quickly realize your mistake. The passengers tried to warn you, but it was too late. When you opened the doors to get off, only the void of space stared back. And so you found your seat.

This is your life now it seems. Along with the other passengers, you travel from planet to planet, decade to decade. Sometimes the train stops in an abandoned town of an alien planet. Sometimes in the meat fridge of a New York deli. Always at midnight. You can leave, the conductor reminds you, but the train leaves at midnight—whether you’re on it or not.
