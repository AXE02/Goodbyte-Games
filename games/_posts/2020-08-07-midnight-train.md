short: Midnight Train is a framework for fluidly moving between game systems within a single narrative.

There is an endless sea of TTRPG one-shots, rulesets, systems, and simply not enough time to try them all. To cut down on the time to set up, create a character, introduce the group, and begin a story, *Midnight Train* links different one-shots together into a longer, continuous game. It does so by providing two things: a narrative framing device and a set of accompanying mechanics. 


{:#frame}
## The Framing Device

You are on a train, travelling through space and time. You do not know where it is headed next, and you are beginning to suspect that even the Conductor is unaware. The train looks like any other 1940s steam locomotive: asteroids and space debris ricocheting off the cowcatcher, stars and planets streaked across your window. From inside the cabin, you can hear the chug of the engine. You and the other passengers sit in large green leather seats. First-class. Far more expensive than you could afford.

Each of you got on, either thinking it was your train or just some other door, only to quickly realize your mistake. The other passengers tried to warn you, but it was too late. When you opened the doors to get off, only the void of space stared back. And so you found your seat. 

This is your life now, it seems. Along with the others aboard, you travel from planet to planet, decade to decade. Sometimes the train stops in an abandoned town of an alien planet. Sometimes in the meat fridge of a New York deli. Always at midnight. You can leave, the Conductor reminds you, but the train leaves at midnight—whether you're on it or not.

## Creating the Conductor

The Conductor is your guide to the Midnight Train. They are both a character within the story and the Game Facilitator outside. While most games have this role delegated to a single person, the flexibility of *Midnight Train* allows for the position to change hands from session to session, giving everyone a chance to play different roles. Because of this, it is important that the creation of the Conductor is a collaborative act. Anyone could take up the role, and everyone should feel comfortable doing so.

While you are free to do otherwise, we suggest the Conductor is two things: nameless, and really old. The Conductor should be knowledgable about the world, wise, but not let on too much. Perhaps it is a sinister vagueness, perhaps their memories have faded. As a group, you should decide what the Conductor's personality is, what their gender is, their appearance, and a distinctive voice (could be a literal voice, or a set of vocal inflections, word choices, speech patterns).

The Conductor begins each session by recapping what happened last time, then announcing where the train is stopping next, some words about the world, perhaps an eccentric quote. The Game Facilitator can also use this time to go over the new system (if they haven't yet already). The Conductor then acts as the Game Facilitator, unless in the case of a "GM-less" game, where they assume the role of their player-character.

## Creating a Character

While the game system you play in will change, your character stays true. There are stats that help keep your character consistent (described in the next section). Still, they do not replace the need for you to build a tangible character and play them consistently. Here are some ideas on how to do that.

First, start with an idea. This should be a one-sentence-concept of a character you find intriguing, something short and to the point. For example, "Ruth is a stoic grandmother who knows how to fashion a car bomb and make delicious oatmeal cookies," or "DINK is a (former) sidewalk-cleaning robot with a few loose screws." You can think of this sort of like an elevator pitch: how can I quickly explain the idea behind my character? How quickly can I make you interested in them? Not only will this help your group members understand who your character is, but it also serves as a way to remind yourself of what makes your character themselves.

Now that you know who your character is consider what they'd be good at. *Midnight Train* has four stats: Mind, Body, Soul, and Proficiency. The exact meaning of each of these stats and how to build them is covered in the next section. For now, just think of which you would prioritize for your character.

Additionally, your character has a set of beliefs and a set of instincts. Their beliefs are the things that your character fundamentally believes to be true about the world. These do not need to be actually true—in fact, they shouldn't be. Make the beliefs debatable or even completely false; they should outline the *unique way* your character sees the world (and obviously, true statements are not unique beliefs). For example, "I believe everyone has something to teach me." Come up with anywhere from 2–5 beliefs that reveal something about your character. As you play your character, use your beliefs to guide their decisions; what mistakes would they make because of what they believe? The narrative may (and should) challenge your character's beliefs. In the event of a truly impactful experience, these beliefs may change.

The other section, instincts, is your character's beliefs applied. These are one-sentence guides to how your character acts in certain situations. For example, "when backed into a corner, I always fight dirty." When playing your character, your instincts act as a cheat sheet to how your character behaves. You don't always have to follow them, but you should have a pretty good reason if you don't. Write four or five.

Finally, backstory (slice of life, what you were doing before you got on the train + reason to keep getting back on)

Finally, write down your character's backstory. It is recommended that you complete this step last and leave it as open-ended as you can. It is often our intuition to create complex backstories, hoping that it produces a more tangible, fleshed-out characters. In reality, these backstories are too complicated to play, too much to introduce to your group members, and limit where you can take the character in the future. Instead, let the character's history be a mystery to yourself and others, revealed over time through gameplay. When you are not tied down by pre-written memories and motivations, you are free to improvise, adding backstory elements when the story calls for it and making interesting choices that are relevant to the group. You may not actually enjoy playing the character you wrote out or find that the backstory elements you thought would be cool fall flat. Therefore, you should let this aspect develop organically.

There is one backstory element that is suggested: the moment you got on the train. This story is a useful way to introduce yourself to the group, and it is recommended that everyone recount the event in the first session. The best ones capture a slice of your pre-train life. What were you in the middle of? What was your life? Who did you leave behind? This will not only give others a digestible insight into your character's life but remind you of where they are coming from and what motivates them to stay on the train. For example, perhaps you got in an elevator to go visit your grandmother. Still, the doors opened onto the train instead of floor 8. Maybe she lives in a cramped two-bedroom apartment with your parents and siblings, and you were excited to see your whole family for the first time in months. Perhaps you were running late because your manager asked you to work an extended shift again. There is a lot this slice-of-life tells us about this character, what they value, and why they might be motivated to stay on the train (the hope that it will one day take them back to their family).
